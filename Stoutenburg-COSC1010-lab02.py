# String concatenation 
    # Finally we will take a look at string concatenation
    # String concatenation combines two strings together
    # It is done using the + operator
    # Create three variables:
        # first_name, which is your first name 
        # last_name, which is your last name
        # space, which is a space character 
    # Use string concatenation to print out your full name 
first_name = "reuben"
last_name = "stoutenburg"
space = " "
full_name = first_name + last_name
print(full_name.title())
